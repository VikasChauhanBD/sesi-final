- **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, .
- **Architecture:** RESTful API, Full-stack monorepo.

**key DB schema**

- **Modified Collection:** : An  field (ObjectId referencing ) was added.

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- **/app/frontend/src/admin/ApplicationDetail.js**: **(NEEDS FIX)** This file contains the broken links for document viewing, which is the current P0 task.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/Registration.js**: This file is related to the user-reported state/district dropdown issue (which works on preview).
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/Home.js**: Was heavily modified with new sections and fixes.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/Gallery.js**: Was completely rewritten for the new album-based system.
- **/app/frontend/src/admin/ManageGallery.js**: Was completely rewritten for album management.
- **/app/backend/routers/admin.py**: Contains the new CRUD endpoints for gallery albums.
- **/app/backend/models/models.py**: Contains the new  model.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **URL Handling:** The issue of missing the  prefix for static assets has occurred multiple times. A global helper function, like , could be created in the frontend to prepend the backend URL and  prefix consistently, preventing future bugs.

**key api endpoints**
- **New Admin Endpoints:**
    - 
    - 
    - 
    - 
- **New Public Endpoints:**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- Your immediate priority is to fix the broken document links in  by adding the  prefix to the URLs. This is a critical bug blocking a core admin workflow.
- Do not attempt to fix the state/district dropdown issue. It has been verified as working on the preview environment. Wait for the user to provide more specific details (URL, browser, device) before investigating further.
- Be aware of the recurring bug pattern: static files (images, PDFs) served from the backend require an  prefix in their URL for the frontend to access them correctly through the ingress.
