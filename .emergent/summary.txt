   - Create a member profile in the system, viewable in the admin panel and a public members' directory with expandable profiles.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.
- **Backend:** The backend is substantially complete. It includes APIs for admin authentication, public data retrieval, membership application submission, a contact form, and a full admin API for managing applications, members, committees, events, news, and gallery. An automated workflow creates member records and generates PDF certificates upon application approval.
- **Frontend:** The public-facing site has been built to mirror , including pages for Home, About, Committee (with individual profiles), News, Events, Publications, Resources, etc. The Admin Panel has a complete UI for managing applications, members, committee, events, news, and the gallery.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing a batch of UI/UX fixes based on user feedback. The last concrete action was stating the intention to update  to remove the Associate Member option from the form, after having already updated the Homepage layout, Admin Committee page (for photo uploads), and Admin Members page (for expandable profiles).
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? both. Frontend changes need screenshot verification for each fix. Backend changes (like committee photo uploads) need  tests followed by frontend verification.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1:  (P0) Member profile expansion and certificate download is not working on the public Members page.
  - Issue 2:  (P0) The homepage committee layout is incorrect.
  - Issue 3:  (P0) Associate Member references must be removed from the entire application.
  - Issue 4:  (P1) The color scheme is too bright and needs to be toned down to a more professional amber/red.
  - Issue 5:  (P1) The admin panel lacks functionality to upload profile pictures for committee members.
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent updated the *admin* members page () to have an expandable view. However, the user's feedback likely refers to a public-facing Members Directory page which hasn't been created or fixed yet. The PDF download link is also reported as non-functional.
     - Next debug checklist:
       1. Create or identify the public-facing Members Directory page.
       2. Implement an expandable profile view for each member, showing all their details.
       3. Ensure the certificate download link is present and correctly points to the backend path (e.g., ).
       4. Test by clicking the download link.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a core feature for a professional society website, allowing public verification of members.

     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 2: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent overwrote .
     - Next debug checklist:
       1. Review the new  and compare it to the user's requirement: President on top, other office-bearers below, and Executive Committee members in a horizontally scrolling single line.
       2. Adjust the JSX and CSS (likely using Flexbox or Grid) to achieve the desired layout.
       3. Verify with a screenshot.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? To match the user's specific design request for the homepage's structure.

     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 4: 
     - Attempted fixes: Agent updated the  component with a new color scheme.
     - Next debug checklist:
       1. The color change needs to be propagated globally. The best approach is to define the new toned-down amber color in  and  as a primary color variable.
       2. Replace the old bright color classes (, , etc.) throughout the application with the new CSS variable or Tailwind class.
       3. Verify the changes on multiple pages (Home, Committee, News) via screenshots.

     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 5: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent overwrote  to add a file input field. The backend logic to handle the upload is missing.
     - Next debug checklist:
       1. Create a new backend endpoint in  to handle committee member profile picture uploads (e.g., ). This endpoint should save the file and update the member's document with the file path.
       2. Update the  model in  to include a  field.
       3. In , update the form submission logic to call this new endpoint after creating/updating a member.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, MongoDB (with ), Pydantic, JWT for authentication, , .
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, .
- **Architecture:** RESTful API, Full-stack monorepo.

**key DB schema**
- **MongoDB Collections:**
  - : {email, hashed_password, role}
  - : {name}
  - : {name, state_id}
  - : {full_name, email, status, ...}
  - : {full_name, email, membership_id, certificate_path, join_date, ...}
  - : {full_name, designation, email, year, slug, qualifications, profile_image_url, ...}
  - : {title, date, location, ...}
  - : {title, content, category, ...}
  - : {title, image_url, ...}

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- : Needs layout adjustment for the committee section.
- : Was updated for expandable profiles, but might not be what the user meant.
- : Needs backend logic for photo upload.
- : Needs Associate Member option removed.
-  & : Should be updated for the new color scheme.
- : Will need a new endpoint for committee photo uploads.
- :  model will need a  field.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The agent created files like  and . This could lead to confusion and should be consolidated.
- The color scheme changes should be centralized in  or  rather than applied on a per-component basis to ensure consistency.

**key api endpoints**
- : Submits a new membership application.
- : Admin login.
- : Approves or rejects an application.
- : Fetches all approved members.
- : Fetches committee members for a given year.
- : Fetches a single committee member.
- : Submits the contact form.
- , : Fetches public news and events.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user has just provided a critical list of 5 UI/UX fixes and functionality gaps. Addressing these is the absolute top priority (P0).
- The agent has already started working on this batch of fixes by overwriting several frontend files but has not completed or tested any of them. You must resume this work, test each fix individually, and ensure the backend is updated where necessary (e.g., for photo uploads).
- Pay close attention to the distinction between the admin panel and the public-facing site. The user's feedback (THE MEMBERS OPAGE) likely refers to the public site, which needs a new Members Directory page. The agent previously modified the *admin* members page, which may have been a misinterpretation.

  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created:
    - 
    - 
  - Known regressions: The user-reported issues from the last message.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- **Admin URL:** 
- **Username:** 
- **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has started work on the user's latest feedback but has not completed or tested any of the five requested changes. The immediate task is to finish implementing this entire batch of fixes.
- A public-facing Members Directory page, as implied by user feedback and the PRD, has not been explicitly created. This is a pending upcoming task.</analysis>
