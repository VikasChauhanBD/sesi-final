<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a modern, fast, and SEO-friendly website for the Shoulder & Elbow Society of India (SESI). The project is modeled on  but aims for a cleaner, better-structured, and future-proof implementation.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**

**1. Public Pages:**
   - Home, About SESI, Executive Committee, Office Bearers (Year-wise), Members Directory (filterable), Membership (Eligibility, Types, Apply Online), Education (Courses, Fellowships, Workshops), Conferences & Events (Upcoming, Past), Publications, Gallery, News & Announcements, Contact Us.

**2. Admin Panel (Core Requirement):**
   - Secure login with role-based access (Admin/Editor).
   - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Committee members, Events, Members, News, and Gallery images.
   - Year-based tagging for committee members.
   - A workflow to review membership applications (view details, download documents, approve/reject).
   - SEO management fields for every page.

**3. Membership Registration Form ( equivalent):**
   - Detailed form with fields for personal details, addresses, and professional qualifications.
   - Required document uploads (MBBS, Orthopedic, State Registration certificates).
   - Dynamic dependent dropdowns for State -> District.
   - Both client-side and server-side validation.

**4. Post-Approval Workflow:**
   - On application approval, automatically generate a unique membership registration number.
   - Automatically generate a digital certificate (PDF).
   - Send an email to the applicant with the membership number and the certificate attached.
   - Create a member profile in the system, which should be viewable in the admin panel.

**5. Database:**
   - A normalized schema to store all data for users, members, committees, events, applications, etc.

**6. UI/UX:**
   - Clean, professional, academic look with a neutral color palette (white, light grey, deep blue/green accents).
   - Easy navigation, especially for senior surgeons.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.
- **Backend:** The backend is substantially complete. It includes APIs for authentication, public data retrieval (states, districts), membership application submission with file uploads, and a comprehensive admin API for managing applications. An automated workflow exists that, upon an admin's approval of an application, generates a membership number, creates a PDF certificate, sends a mock email, and creates a new member record. 5 demo applications have been created for testing.
- **Frontend:** The basic structure for the public-facing site and admin panel is in place with routing. The membership registration form is fully functional, including the dependent state-district dropdowns. A complete admin panel UI for reviewing, approving, and rejecting membership applications has been built. A new Members management page has been added to the admin panel to display profiles of approved members.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The user pointed out that after an application is accepted, the member's profile should be visible in the admin panel. The agent implemented this by automatically creating a  document upon approval and adding a Members page to the admin UI. However, it was discovered that the  was not being saved correctly to the new member profile, showing as 'N/A'. The agent was in the process of fixing this data transfer issue.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? backend testing agent. The agent needs to modify the backend logic to correctly pass the  when creating a member from an application. Testing should involve approving a test application and then using  to query the  endpoint to verify that the  is correctly populated for the newly created member.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1:  (P0) Certificate path is 'N/A' on the new admin Members page.
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent identified that the  field was not being copied from the approved application to the new member document. No code fix has been attempted yet.
     - Next debug checklist: 
       - Modify  in the  function.
       - When creating the  dictionary, ensure the  from the approved application document is included.
       - The logic should look something like: .
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? Fixing this will complete the automated member creation workflow, allowing admins to see the approved member's details and download their certificate directly from the Members management page.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Backend.
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  (P0) Finalize the Members Admin Page UI.
  
 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: The file  has been created. It currently fetches and displays member data. It needs to be reviewed to ensure it clearly shows the membership number and provides a functional download link for the certificate once the backend issue is resolved.
     - What will be achieved with this? A complete admin interface for managing active society members, as requested by the user.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both.
     - Blocked on something: Issue 1 (Certificate path is 'N/A').

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS,  for API calls.
- **Architecture:** RESTful API, Full-stack monorepo.

**key DB schema**
- **MongoDB Collections:**
  - : {email, hashed_password, role}
  - : {name}
  - : {name, state_id}
  - : {full_name, email, status, membership_type, application_details..., certificate_path, membership_id}
  - : {application_id, doc_type, file_path}
  - : {full_name, email, membership_id, certificate_path, join_date, ...}
  - (Collections for , , ,  are defined in models but not yet used by a UI).

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- **Backend (created/modified):**
  - : Main FastAPI app, registers all routers.
  - : Defines all Pydantic models for database collections.
  - : Contains API logic for application approval/rejection and member creation.
  - : Handles new application submissions.
  - : Logic for generating PDF certificates.
  - : Contains database connection details.
- **Frontend (created/modified):**
  - : Main router setup for all public and admin pages.
  - : The public-facing membership application form.
  - : Admin UI to view a single application and approve/reject it.
  - : Admin UI to view profiles of approved members.
  - : Centralized  instance for API calls.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The placeholder pages in  should be replaced with components that fetch and render live data.

**key api endpoints**
- : Submits a new membership application.
- : Admin login.
- : Fetches all membership applications for the admin panel.
- : Approves or rejects an application. This endpoint triggers member/certificate creation.
- : Fetches all approved members.
- : Gets a list of all states.
- : Gets districts for a given state.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The project is a full-stack build for a medical society website based on detailed user requirements.
- **Key decisions made:** The new domain is , emails are mocked (logged to console), and file storage is local in . Payment integration is deferred.
- **Core Workflow:** The application approval process is highly automated. When an admin approves an application via the UI, the backend automatically generates a member ID, creates a PDF certificate, and creates a new  record. Your current task is to fix a bug in this flow.
- The user is technically savvy and provides specific, actionable feedback. Pay close attention to their requests.
