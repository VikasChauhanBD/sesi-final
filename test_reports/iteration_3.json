All 5 P0 issues verified: 1) Members Directory with expandable profiles and certificate download working 2) Homepage committee layout correct (President->Office Bearers->EC Members) 3) Registration page shows only Life Member 4) Amber color scheme applied 5) Admin Committee photo upload working. Fixed critical bug: certificate/image downloads were returning HTML due to ingress routing - changed static files mount from /uploads to /api/uploads.",
